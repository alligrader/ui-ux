## Professor Bill Laboon

### Feature List:
0. Obviously the automatic test-running in dockerized environments using git version control
1. A Page with all grades for the course with a statistical breakdown (specifically mentioned a D3 bell-curve char), that could be easily downloaded.
2. Students should be able to see the finished project after a certain deadline.
3. Integration with Courseweb (he said that's what Pitt students expect, but if we had enough info on this site--for example, if they could see their grades and syllabus for this course--then it wouldn't be necessary, and he'd be happy to avoid Courseweb altogether.)
4. Cheating detection. Apparently it's a bigger problem than we realized and it would be great if we could just automate most of it.
5. Module system where professors could add to or pull from a pool of projects and questions for a course
6. Generation of interactive student study questions (specially ​types​ of questions that could be dynamically-generated, rather than hard-coded questions)
7. Course and project feedback
8. Generation of CS test questions and answer keys. Again, this could be from a pool or from the generated study questions, but right now it's apparenly a pain to make up the physical tests themselves (accounting for points appropriately, making sure the test covers material sufficiently, etc.) It doesn't need to be some, like, genetic algorithm generating appropriate content, more like a tool that keeps track of questions an answers and how much they are worth, and prints out a physical test and answer key.
