### Judith

![Judith](./judith.jpeg "Judith")

- 18
- Freshman student at the University of Pittsburgh
- Originally from right outside Philly 
- Plans to major in CS, or possibly engineering
- Misses her Cat, Daisy

#### About

Judith is in the midst of her first year at the University of Pittsburgh. Still deciding between engineering and computer science, she has taken on a courseload full of classes from both fields. She has used some HTML and CSS in the past, but she is otherwise new to programming. She has always been good with math and science though, and she likes to push herself to try new things. She enjoys both the challenge and the feeling of achievement you get after mastering something difficult. She has been excelling in her CS classes, but she is having a hard time learning GitHub on top of learning how to program. She wishes it were easier to submit her projects and test them, since she has to do this so frequently. It would also be nice if she could see her grades more quickly.

#### Traits

- Newb
- Young and excited
- Learns quickly
- Technically minded
- Enjoys a challenge

#### Quotes

"How do you spell GitHub?"

"The command line seems scary to me."

"How do I know if I have submitted my assignment?"

#### Frustrations

- She is not familiar with GitHub yet
- She has to test the program herself, which she doesn't know how to do yet
- This is a lot of information for her

## Group: Professors

### Bill

![Bill](./bill.jpg "Bill")

- 45
- Lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh
- Former industry professional
- Married, 1 kid
- Pittsburgher, born and raised

#### About

Bill is a 45 year old computer science lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. He has much industry experience and has only just begun his venture into academia. Bill wants to bridge the gap between the expectations of industry and the theoretical curriculum. He enjoys working with his students and sharing his knowledge with them. He just hates grading the assignments because it can be so time-consuming and arduous. He is looking for a program to automatically test and grade assignments, _and_ keep track of the grades. While the TA would still have a job checking everything, it would save everyone a lot of time and effort.

#### Traits

- Passionate & energetic
- Cares about his students
- Keeps up with new technology
- New to teaching

#### Quotes

"I would have given a million dollars to be able to go to the park with my son instead of grading papers."

"I need to be able to see all of my students grades for all of their projects, and to be able to print it out."

"You wouldn't believe how many people try cheating, and I feel compelled to check on that."

"It would be great if students could have study guide questions generated."

#### Frustrations

- Bill is frustrated that he needs to manually enter in grades, manually update grades, and manually check assignments.
- He can't see the bell curve for assignments.
- He can't configure git repositories in bulk for his classes.

## Group: TAs

### Roger

![Roger](./roger.jpg "Roger")

- 21
- Undergraduate senior at the University of Pittsburgh
- International student from China
- CS major, math minor
- Lives with his girlfriend in a shitty apartment in South Oakland

#### About

Roger is an undergraduate in his final year at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh. He has been working as a TA since his sophomore year and has grown very used to his regular tasks. This doesn't mean he likes them, though. On top of his 2.5 hours of class time each week, plus weekly recitations and review sessions, he frequently has to spend additional hours grading his students' projects. He has to test each project individually, and he has to run all the inputs and outputs every time. While he doesn't mind the extra pay, he would rather be working on projects of his own or hanging out with his friends and his girlfriend during their final year of college. 

#### Traits

- Busy
- Complacent towards students
- Focused on many different things
- Student peer

#### Quotes

"This grading set up feels like a waste of my time."

"I'll still have a job though, right?"

"I would prefer to be working on research."

#### Frustrations

- Current grading system is laborious
- It varies from professor to professor, and he has to relearn how to do it
